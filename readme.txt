This is manly a project for me to learn lisp. I started from http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html and thought I would futher develop the world, and maybe have the problems be more towards programming/logic.

There will be a frontend in html/css/javascript that communicates with a lisp backend. This is all running on a hunchentoot server. Have some thought of using nginx as a proxy, but that is when the game has had some more work.
